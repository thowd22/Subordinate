//! WASM plugin host on wasmtime: manifests, capabilities, WIT worlds and hot
//! reload.
//!
//! Plugins are sandboxed WebAssembly components with versioned WIT
//! interfaces. Fuel and epoch limits keep a misbehaving plugin from stalling
//! the engine. See docs/PLAN.md §6.
//!
//! # The host interface
//!
//! `wit/subordinate-plugin.wit` declares `subordinate:plugin@0.1.0`. Every
//! plugin world imports the one `command-api` interface, which is the
//! plugin-side view of the Command API (decision-6, decision-7):
//!
//! - `run-command(project, method, params)` — a JSON-RPC method name and its
//!   `params` object, exactly what the local socket server takes, so a plugin
//!   and an external agent have the same reach. Each success is one undoable
//!   command on the host's stack.
//! - `query(project, method, params)` — the read-only half, same encoding.
//! - `open-projects`, `project-info`, `sequences`, `tracks`, `clips`,
//!   `markers`, `playhead` — the
//!   metadata accessors, which return records rather than JSON because their
//!   shape is fixed and a plugin should not have to parse to learn the
//!   timebase it must respect.
//! - `log(level, message)` — a line into the host's `tracing` subscriber,
//!   tagged with the plugin id.
//!
//! [`bindings`] holds the generated host side of that world; [`convert`] maps
//! its records onto [`sub_core::SubError`], [`sub_time::RationalTime`] and the
//! `sub_model` identifiers, so an implementation of the generated `Host` trait
//! (TASK-84) never hand-builds a record.
//!
//! ```
//! use sub_plugin::{WitError, WitRationalTime};
//! use sub_core::{ErrorCode, SubError};
//! use sub_time::{Rational, RationalTime};
//!
//! // A host error crossing out to a plugin keeps its stable code.
//! let error = SubError::new(ErrorCode::from_static("plugin.no_such_project"), "gone");
//! assert_eq!(WitError::from(&error).code, "plugin.no_such_project");
//!
//! // A playhead crosses as an exact fraction, never as seconds.
//! let time = RationalTime::from_frames(1, Rational::FPS_29_97);
//! assert_eq!(RationalTime::try_from(WitRationalTime::from(time)).unwrap(), time);
//! ```
//!
//! # The manifest
//!
//! [`manifest`] parses `plugin.toml` (docs/PLAN.md §6.3): identity, the
//! interface version the plugin was built against, its WIT worlds, the
//! capabilities it asks for and the MCP tools it contributes. [`schema`]
//! exports its JSON Schema, committed at `docs/schema/plugin-manifest.json`.
